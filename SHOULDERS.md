# Redact stands on the shoulders of giants

Redact project doesn't try to reinvent the wheel. It is based on great ideas put together by other projects, and it uses the already great wheels developed by the Go community and puts them together in the best way possible. Without these giants, this project would not be possible. Please make sure to check them out and thank them for all of their hard work.

Thank you for the following **GIANTS**:

* [sensu](https://github.com/sensu/sensu): Original Sensu is a monitoring project, which contains best of the old, signal alerting systems (like Nagios), and measurement-based systems like Prometheus in a reliable way.
* [sensu go](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-go): A new, independent project for similar goals as what Sensu was standing for. Now it's even more robust, more scalable, and more performant than its predecessor. It is also happened to be written in Go.
* [sensu community plugins](https://github.com/sensu-plugins): this organization is a goldmine for various sensu plugins. They are battle-tested, well-written. The majority of the plugins are written in ruby.
* [ataccama/sensu-plugins-go](https://github.com/ataccama/sensu-plugins-go): a nicely written set of sensu plugins, written in simplicity and robustness in mind.

This project uses go modules, so please have a look of [go.sum](go.sum) for all the Go **GIANTS** this project is stand upon.
